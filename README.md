# r_crypto_sentiment

Got a trading idea to backtest and further investigate. The idea is to find altcoins that are potentially gaining market cap significantly in short coming future. For example, from top 100 to top 20 in terms of market cap. The price movements are largely driven by credible news or FUD marketing. 

1.	Download a list of coin identifiers from coinmarketcap.
2.	Do a social media sentiment analysis on coins.
3.	Join the sentiment data with coin price data to see if it proves to be opportunistic.
